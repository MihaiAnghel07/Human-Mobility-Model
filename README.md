This research paper focuses on the study of the concept of human mobility and the implemented models that provide an objective perspective on real-life situations in which people carry out their daily activities, often following common patterns that can be anticipated to a significant extent. Another key objective of the study is the development of a human mobility model capable of generating a solution that approximates movement, human interactions, and behavioral patterns within a realistic scenario. This solution is based either on a dataset collected from real-life activities or on a synthetically generated one that accurately reflects the structure and characteristics of an authentic dataset. The implementation of this model involves several essential stages, including the selection of a suitable scenario, the analysis of its specific attributes, the design of an algorithm by enforcing constraints on those attributes, the acquisition of a relevant dataset, and finally, the analysis and calibration of the results obtained from running the model on the selected dataset.
The conclusions highlight the success of the research project through the development of a human mobility model that provides a fairly accurate approximation of human behavior in the chosen scenario.
